						This assignment is first assignment of my 1st term, which include many learnings, knowledge, failures and basics of web development.<br> Here, I created 5 pages as defined in brief that includes Homepage (index.html), Portfolio (portfolio.html), CV (cv.html), Contact page( contact.html) and Site report (sitereport.html). <br>Each page has linked with each other and there is presence of hamburger menu, which can be visible in mobile view. I used the same overall website layout and we can reach each page from navigation menu, which is consistent across each page of website. I made it responsive which is adaptive according to different screen size.

						<span> Homepage:</span>
						<br>
						At first, I created my homepage (index.html). This page contains logo of my website aligned towards left along with navlist aligned right in the desktop view. This page took long time for it’s layout as I was not ready with my plan. I reviewed my all notes, lectures remembered tips and tricks of CSS and HTML  taught by my tutor Thapa Ankit (2021). Overall duration of first term was great learning time with Mr Thapa.
					
						<br>
						- I introduced my homepage with animation which I learned few months ago from:<br> Easy Tutorials (2021) How To Make A Website With Sliding Text Using HTML And CSS step by step.

						<br>
					<p>
						- My purpose of building this website and my responsibilities are also texted in this page. In mobile view, logo is at center and hamburger menu and navlist are at left. The hamburger can be toggle so that navlist is visible or to hide navlist. For responsive hamburger I referenced one of video of my favourite youtube tutor: <br> CodeWithHarry (2020) Create a Responsive Website Using  HTML, CSS & JavaScript in Hindi.

						<span> Debugging: </span><br>
					
						In mobile view, I set to display navlist into rows when hamburger is toggled along with moving ".textbox", which covered more area than I mentioned showing unnecessary blank area toward bottom. So, I fixed with adjusting navlist to display its element in columns.
						<br>
						<br>
							- Image of website with previous navlist layout is given below.
						<img src="img/pnavlist.png" alt="initial navlist layout image">
						<br>
							- Overflowing height of ".container" showing blank in bottom:
						<img src="img/overflown.png" alt="Overflowing height of container showing blank in bottom">
						<br>
							- There was searchbar at right handside top of website which was not giving the good looks for my website so I removed that searchbar which made this website simple and attractive. For Consistence design according to screensize, I defined mediaqueries for different max-width i.e.( 1262px, 794px, 500px, 400px)
					</p>

						This page contains overall review of my website. This is one of the hard task that, I felt in my life. With little knowledge of HTML I started my Bsc(Hons)Computing program. Now, after completion of my assignment I gained enough knowledge for simple layout of website.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						 At the time, I received this assignment notice I was not feeling well, I was suffering from mild type of Covid-19. This depressed me thinking that, “I am sure to fail, if couldn’t finished this task “. After few days I was feeling good and then started to do this tasks. Initially, at start of module each property of CSS was confusing and hard to remember. It was hard to complete tasks during tutorial session. Now, due to enough hardwork and consistency, I am able to complete my first term assignment task.
					</p>
					<br> 
					<p>
						 This project took many days, many hours for its completion. For professional, it is about some few minutes task but truly, for me it took more than 14 days.
						 <br>
						 <br>
						 Debugging process was very hard job for me, as I created desktop view first with some fixed flex property that not letting its element to move, the hamburger menu was no adjusting according to my will the navlist elements was overflowing from its position. The leaving text items along with change in screen size also burden me.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Forgetting, all pain that I suffered during this assignment, it was joy to learn to build portfolio website. Many researched and time to time reviewing, reading notes, slides made possible to complete this task. Leaving greediness of time, I filled it full of my valuable time. Hope! You liked my overall website. 
						<br>
						Sincerely yours,
